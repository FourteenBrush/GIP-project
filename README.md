# GIP-project
Informatics project made on my last year highschool

This is an application that focuses on shops, with the purpose of giving an overview of products and customers
It provides a few things:
- Support for creating new products, modyfying or deleting those
- Gives an overview of customers
- A small (not fully implemented) feature that allows you to add purchases from the store

The project is made in C#, working with Windows Forms
We store all the data the application needs in a hardcoded MySQL database (yes i know it's hardcoded)

This definitly isn't working perfect but be free to have some inspiration by this project
