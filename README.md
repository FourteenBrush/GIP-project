# GIP-project
Informatics project made on my last year highschool

This project shows an overview for products and customers and it is able to make changes to those
It also provides you with a way to order products (not fully implemented)

The project is made in C#, working with Windows Forms
We also use a hardcoded database path, currently interacting with a MySQL database

This definitly isn't working perfectly as it should but be free to have some inspiration :)
